# OHW Project Datasets of the Past

## OHW23 Projects
List of OHW23 projects and datasets used:

1. The [Oil Spill Monitoring](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_oil) team used images taken from a [SAR-2000](https://space.oscar.wmo.int/instruments/view/sar_2000) imaging sensor on the second [COSMO-SkyMed](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/cosmo-skymed) satellite called [CSKS2](https://space.oscar.wmo.int/satellites/view/csk_2).
2. The [Marine SDM](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/tutorials_marine_sdm) team produced a beautiful tutorial accessing OBIS via `robis` and environmental data via the `SMDpredictor` R package. Their tutorial is already so good that we should highlight it on the website, IMO.

3. [Inertial oscillations in the marginal ice zone](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_sea_ice_oscillations): used data from the [VIIRS instruments](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/data/get-started-data/collection-overview/missions/s-npp-nasa-viirs-overview/) installed on the [Joint Polar Satellite System](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/our-satellites/currently-flying/joint-polar-satellite-system). Cloud-based data from the Suomi-NPP and JPSS-1/NOAA-20 satellites was accessed from [EarthDataSearch](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search).
4. [Machine learning for Argo Data QC](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_argo_ml): data accessed via argopy.
5. [Benthic habitat mapping](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23-proj-habitatmapping): used some kind of geodata but I can't tell from where at a glance. [This notebook](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23-proj-habitatmapping/blob/main/Download%20data.ipynb) seems to be for downloading data
6. [Mooring processing and data page (“fancy moorings”)](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_fancymoorings): used data from [CIOOS Moorings](https://catalogue.cioospacific.ca/dataset/ca-cioos_82656721-88e6-4543-90f1-edc35c0f42c9) and [NANOOS Moorings](https://nwem.apl.washington.edu/erddap/index.html). They also made their own [website](https://oceanhackweek.org/ohw23_proj_fancymoorings/). 
7. [SST spatial distribution prediction using machine learning](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_sst): used MUR Satellite Data (2002-present) from an S3 bucket, and [NASA website](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1)
8. [Passive acoustics monitoring](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23-proj-pamproject): used https://registry.opendata.aws/pacific-sound/ and imos-data/IMOS/ANMN/Acoustic/ (maybe [this one](https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/e850651b-d65d-495b-8182-5dde35919616)?)
9. [Direct geo referencing drone images](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_drone_georef): Drone survey carried out in 14 February (CSIRO Kensington)
10. [Variability of the suppression of South Australian upwelling](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_SAupwelling): IMOS bucket for SA coastal mooring data: http://imos-data.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=IMOS/ANMN/SA/
IMOS bucket for SA NRS station data: http://imos-data.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=IMOS/ANMN/NRS/NRSKAI/
SA coastal moorings and NRS station technical summary, where you can find the code names for active and deactivated moorings which are important to download the data from the IMOS bucket: https://imos.org.au/facilities/nationalmooringnetwork/samoorings
AODN portal: https://portal.aodn.org.au/search 
11. [Bioinformatic pipelines for standardized output](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw23_proj_amplicon): Created a custom reference database using only fish species from the OBITools reference database (see the [Wolves tutorial](https://pythonhosted.org/OBITools/wolves.html) for more information).
